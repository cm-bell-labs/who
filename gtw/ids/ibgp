                                 Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP), that eliminates the route update oscillations and routing
   loops in Internal BGP (IBGP) even in the presence of route reflection.

1. Introduction

   We describe an extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [1],
   that eliminates route oscillations and routing
   loops in Internal BGP (IBGP) even in the presence of route reflection [2].

   The rest of the document is organized as follows:
   + Section 2 gives an overview of the problem;
   + Section 3 describes an extension to BGP;
   + Section 4 outlines the intellectual property rights issues;
   + Section 5 contains acknowledgments; and
   + Section 6 contains references.


2. Brief Description of the Route Oscillation Problem

Eliminating IBGP Oscillations                                   [Page 2]


   For a given Autonomous System (AS), consider the routes chosen as the
   best routes by each router in the AS to some given fixed destination
   d.  We call the set of such routes a routing.  Then a routing is said
   to be a stable routing if no router would change its best route after
   being sent the best routes of all of its BGP neighbors.

   The route oscillation problem we consider occurs when some subset of
   routers within an Autonomous System (AS) exchange route update
   information forever without ever settling on a stable routing to a
   particular destination.

   There are actually two classes of possible route oscillations
   (1) persistent route oscillations is the case when there does
   not exist any stable routing (i.e., where no matter what route
   each router chooses, there will always be at least one router
   that will change to a more preferred route when its neighbors
   announce their current choices) and
   (2) transient route oscillations where there are multiple
   stable routings but because of timing coincidences they do not
   settle on one until such timing coincidences fail to occur.

   It is known that in certain network configurations, a combination of
   route reflectors [2] and the use of the Multi-Exit Discriminator
   (MED) attribute [1] can lead to persistent route oscillations [3].
   In fact, it has been noted that the use of route reflectors alone in
   the absence of MEDs can lead to persistent or transient route
   oscillations [4].  Also, whether or not route reflectors are used,
   configurations using the MED attribute can lead to transient route
   oscillations[5].  The real problem with the potential for transient
   route oscillations is not that such timing coincidences could occur
   indefinitely but the fact that a router could adopt radically
   different routes depending on the timing of route update messages.
   This non-determinism can result in routers converging to one stable
   routing but later, after a re-start, the routers could choose other
   routes.  In fact, there are cases where one stable routing actually
   fails to respect the semantics of the MED attribute.  Moreover, such
   behavior can make traffic estimations and debugging less transparent.

   For an example of persistent route oscillations consider the
   configuration in Figure 1.  This figure is taken from [4].  In the
   figure there are three route reflectors RR1, RR2 and RR3 in the same
   AS where C1 is a client of RR1, C2 is a client of RR2 and C3 is a
   client of RR3.  In the left side of the figure are shown the BGP
   sessions.  Internally, each route reflector and its client establish
   a BGP session, and each route reflector has a BGP session with every
   other route reflector.  In addition, each client router has an E-BGP
   session with some router R in another AS.  In the right side of the
   figure we show the hardware links within the AS and their IGP
   weights.  It is straightforward to check for example that RR1 will
   constantly switch between choosing the route to R through its client
   C1 and through the client C2 depending on which route RR2 announces
   to RR1.  The other route reflectors exhibit analogous behavior.

   Admittedly, the configuration in Figure 1 is not likely in a

   reasonable network.  The point though is that such behavior is
   possible with route reflectors and in fact it can be shown that
   determining if there are routes that each router can choose so that
   they do not constantly oscillate is "difficult" (i.e., NP-complete)
   [5].

3 An Extension to BGP

   Normally, BGP route selection proceeds step
   by step until just one route remains.
   That sole remaining route is that router's best route and
   it may or may not be announced to its BGP neighbors depending
   on the particular relationship between them.
   For example, if there is only one route with the highest
   LOCAL_PREF value, then that route is chosen.
   Otherwise, the procedure continues with additional steps
   such as choosing those routes with the shortest AS_PATH
   length and so on.

   If the best route is determined before the BGP route
   selection process reaches the tie-breaking stages involving
   E-BGP routes versus I-BGP routes, then the proposed extension
   to BGP does nothing different from normal BGP.
   However if there remain multiple potential routes at this
   stage of the route selection process (that is, at the
   end of the stage in the selection procedure involved with
   comparing MED values), then the extension
   says to advertise all these surviving routes to I-BGP neighbors
   according to the usual rules for route reflectors and client
   routers and then to proceed with the tie-breaking selection process
   to determine that router's best route as with normal BGP.

Eliminating IBGP Oscillations                                   [Page 4]


   Despite the fact that this procedure would result in a router
   announcing routes in addition to its best route, it has been
   proven that even in the presence of a single layer of route reflectors,
   the process will result in routers choosing routes that
   form a stable routing [5].
   Also, it is proven that this process will not result in any
   routing loops or routing oscillations of any kind [5].
   This shows that the routing decisions due to this
   extension are deterministic in
   the sense that routers will always return to the same routes
   after failures and re-starts.

   As an example, consider again the configuration shown in Figure 1.
   The modified BGP process will have router RR1 always announcing
   the route through C1 even though it will choose the route
   through C2 as its best route.
   Similarly, RR2 will choose the route through C3 and RR3 will
   choose the route through C1.

   An obvious drawback to this modification is the
   fact that additional routes must be announced and more
   importantly stored by the routers.
   Given that a key problem is that router memories are being
   stressed by the number of routes they must keep, requiring
   routers to store even more routes is clearly problematic.
