<H1>USERS' REFERENCE TO B ON MH-TSS
</H1>
<DL><DD><I>S. C. Johnson<br>
Bell Laboratories<br>
Murray Hill, New Jersey<br>
</I></DL>
<H4>1.0 Introduction
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
B is a computer language directly descendant from BCPL [1,2]. A
tutorial introduction to B on the H6070 computer, under MH-TSS,
is given in [3].  The reader is urged to read the examples in
section 9 in parallel with the language description, to get the
flavor of actual B applications.
<br>&#32;<br>
B was designed and implemented by D. M. Ritchie and K. L. Thompson.
The B runtime support for MH-TSS was designed and implemented by S. C. Johnson.
<H4>2.0 Syntax
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The next several sections describe the syntax of B.  Throughout,
reserved words and required characters are underlined, while
names not underlined represent syntactic classes.  Thus, the if
statement is syntactically described by:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement1 </I><TT>else </TT><I>statement2 </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
</TT><H4>2.1 Syntactic Overview
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
B is like most other programming languages in that it has
programs, made up of statements, many of the statements contain
expressions,  and the expressions are made up of operators, names,
and constants, with parentheses used in the usual way to alter
the order of evaluation.
<br>&#32;<br>
B differs from most languages in that it has no types: no type
declarations are needed, and no type conversions are performed.
A variable takes on a type (integer, function, vector, etc.) from
its context in an expression or statement.   Another difference
is the rich operator set of B,  including logical and shift
operators.  B is recursive, but pays only a small penalty for
being so.
<H4>2.2 Comments and Character Sets
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Comments are delimited as in PL/I by /* and */.
<br>&#32;<br>
B programs consist of
<I>tokens</I>
which are names, constants, and
operators.  Normally tokens are separated by blanks, tabs, new-lines,  or comments; in addition,  the compiler treats the
characters
<TT>(){}[],;?:</TT>
and maximal sequences of the characters
<TT>+-*/&#60;&#62;&amp;|!=</TT>
as complete tokens.
<br>&#32;<br>
The character set used in B is ascii.
<br>&#32;<br>
The characters
<TT>A</TT>
through
<TT>Z</TT>,
<TT>a</TT>
through
<TT>z</TT>,
<TT>_</TT>,
<TT>.</TT>,
and backspace are
alphabetic characters and may be used in names.   The characters
O through 9 are digits and may be used in constants or names;
however, a name may not begin with a digit.
<br>&#32;<br>
There are certain members of the character set which are acceptable
in string and character constants, but sometimes hard
to represent.  In these contexts,  escape sequences are provided.
The following escape sequences are currently defined:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
<TT>*0	</TT>null
<TT>*e	</TT>end-of-file
<TT>*(	</TT>{
<TT>*)	</TT>}
<TT>*t	</TT>tab
<TT>**	</TT>*
<TT>*'	</TT>'
<TT>*"	</TT>"
<TT>*n	</TT>new line
</PRE></TT></DL>
All keywords in the language are recognized only in lower case.
Keywords are reserved.
<H4>3.0 Rvalues and Lvalues
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
An
<I>rvalue</I>
is a binary bit pattern of a fixed length.   On the
H6070 it is 36 bits.  rvalues may have different meanings: integers, labels, vectors, functions, etc..   The actual kind of
thing represented is called the type of the rvalue.
<br>&#32;<br>
A B expression can be evaluated to yield an rvalue, but its type
is undefined until the rvalue is used in some context.   It is
then assumed to represent an object of the required type.   For
example, in the following expression
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
a(b/c+d[3])
</PRE></TT></DL>
is taken to be of type function,  since it is followed by a left
parenthesis; b and c are taken to be signed integers; and d is
taken to be of type integer vector, since it is followed by a
left bracket.
<br>&#32;<br>
There is no check to insure that there are no type mismatches.
Similarly, there are no type conversions.
<br>&#32;<br>
An
<I>lvalue</I>
is a binary number ("address") representing a storage
location; thus,  for every lvalue there is an associated rvalue,
the contents of the lvalue.  A variable in B (as in most other
computer languages) has both an lvalue (its address) and an
rvalue (its contents).  Writing:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
x = y
</PRE></TT></DL>
causes the contents (rvalue) of y to be stored into the location
(lvalue) of x.  The rvalue is on the Right side of the assignment, the lvalue is on the Left.
<br>&#32;<br>
Some things (such as constants, expressions, and function calls)
are not permitted to have lvalues in B; thus:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
3 = x
a+b = x
f(3) = x
</PRE></TT></DL>
are all illegal.
There are unary operators, * and &amp;, for converting between
rvalues and lvalues.  Unary *, the
<I>indirection</I>
operator, treats
an rvalue as an lvalue; on the H6070, the rightmost 18 bits of
the rvalue are taken as a machine address.   Thus
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
*3 = x
</PRE></TT></DL>
is legal, and stores the contents of x into memory location 3.
<br>&#32;<br>
Unary &amp;, the
<I>address</I>
operator, does the inverse operation: if x
has an lvalue, &amp;x is the rvalue which has the lvalue of x as the
rightmost 18 bits (with the other bits 0).  Thus,  &amp;x can be
thought of as a pointer to x.  If x has an lvalue, *(&amp;x) is the
same as x; this is just the same as saying that x can be used by
indirecting through a pointer to x.  The opposite identity, that
&amp;(*x) is the same as x, is always formally true but less useful
in practice.
<br>&#32;<br>
Since addresses are stored in the right half of a word, adding
1 to a pointer gives a pointer to the next word in memory.   For
example, the contents of the word immediately following variable
x can be obtained by writing *(&amp;x+1).
<H4>4.0 Expression Evaluation
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The evaluation of expressions (in particular, the binding of the
operators) is done in the same order as the sub-sections of this
section.  Thus expressions referred to as operands of '+' (section 4.4) are expressions defined in sections 4.1 to 4.3.   The
binding of operators at the same level (left to right, right to
left) is specified in each sub-section.
<br>&#32;<br>
This section discusses the binding and meaning of expressions;
the order of evaluation of expressions is undefined.  Thus,
writing:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   f(2) + g(3)
</PRE></TT></DL>
one cannot assume that f will be called before g.
<H4>4.1 Primary Expressions
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
A name is an lvalue of one of three storage classes
(automatic, external and internal).
<DT>2.<DD>
A decimal constant is an rvalue.  It consists of a digit
between 1 and 9 followed by any number of digits between 0
and 9.   The value of the constant should not exceed the
maximum value that can be stored in a word.
<DT>3.<DD>
An octal constant is the same as a decimal constant except
that it begins with a zero.  It is then interpreted in base
8.
<DT>4.<DD>
A character constant is represented by
<TT>'</TT>
followed by one or
more characters (possibly escaped) followed by another
<TT>'</TT>.
It has an rvalue equal to the value of the characters
packed and right adjusted, with zero fill.  Obviously, the
number of characters in a character constant is a machine
dependent quantity; on the H6070,  up to four characters are
allowed.
<DT>5.<DD>
A string is any number of characters between
<TT></TT>
characters.
The characters are packed into adjacent words (lvalues sequential) and terminated with the character
<TT>'*e'</TT>
(ascii
EOT character) .  The rvalue of the string is the lvalue
of the word containing the first character.   See section
8.0 for library functions used to manipulate strings in a
machine independent fashion.  Escapes are available to allow special characters,  such as tab and newline, to be used
in string and character constants (See section 2.2).
<DT>6.<DD>
Any expression in () parentheses is a primary expression.
Parentheses are used to alter order of binding.
<DT>7.<DD>
A vector reference v[n] is a primary expression v followed
by any expression n in
<TT>[]</TT>
brackets.  The two expressions
are evaluated to rvalues,  added and the result is used as
an lvalue.  v can be thought of as a pointer to the base of
a vector, while n can be thought of as the offset in the
vector.  Thus,  if x is a vector, x points to a block of
locations whose names are x[0], x[1], ... .  x[0]
is the
same as *x, x[1] is the same as *(x+1), and so on. A
string is a special case of a vector, where the contents of
the words x[0], x[1], ...  contain packed characters.
<DT>8.<DD>
A function call f(a,b, . . .  ) is a primary expression f followed by any number of expressions in () parentheses
separated by commas.  a, b, . . .  are evaluated (in an unspecified order) to rvalues and assigned to the function's
parameters.  f is evaluated to an rvalue (assumed to be
type function).   The function is then called.   Each call is
recursive at little cost in time or space.  Thus f(),
f(2,x+y,g(1)), and ff[2](e33) are all function references:
in the last example, ff is assumed to be a vector containing functions.
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
Primary expressions are bound left to right.
<H4>4.2  Unary Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The unary operators are *, &amp;, -, !, ++, --, and ~.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The rvalue (or indirection) prefix unary operator
<TT>*</TT>
is
described in section 3.0.
<DT>2.<DD>
The lvalue (or address) prefix unary operator
<DT>&amp;<DD>
is also
described in section 3.0.
<DT>3.<DD>
The operand of the negation prefix unary operator
<TT>-</TT>
is interpreted as an integer.  The result is an rvalue with opposite sign.
<DT>4.<DD>
The NOT prefix unary operator
<TT>!</TT>
takes an integer operand.
The result is zero if the operand is non-zero.   The result
is one if the operand is zero.
<TT>5.</TT>
The increment
<TT>++</TT>
and decrement
<TT>--</TT>
unary operators may be
used either in prefix or postfix form.   Either form requires an lvalue operand.  The contents (rvalue) stored in
the lvalue is either incremented or decremented by one.
The prefix operators return the newly altered value; the
postfix forms return the value before it is incremented or
decremented.  Thus if x currently contains 5, then ++x and
x++ both change x to 6.   The value of ++x is 6 while x++ is
5.  Similarly, --x and x-- change x to 4.   The former has
value 4, the latter 5.
<DT>6.<DD>
The ones complement operator
<TT>~</TT>,
when applied to an rvalue,
turns all 1 bits to 0 and all 0 bits to 1.
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
Unary operators are bound right to left.   Thus  -!x++ is bound
-(!(x++)).
<H4>4.3 Multiplicative Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The multiplicative binary operators
<TT>*</TT>,
<TT>/</TT>,
and
<TT>%</TT>,
expect rvalue integer operands.
The result is also an integer.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The operator
<TT>*</TT>
denotes multiplication.
<DT>2.<DD>
The operator
<TT>/</TT>
denotes division.   The result is correct if
the first operand is divisible by the second.   If both
operands are positive, the result is truncated toward zero.
Otherwise the rounding is undefined,  but never greater than
one.
<DT>3.<DD>
The operator
<TT>%</TT>
denotes modulo.  If both operands are positive, the result is correct.  It is undefined otherwise.
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
The multiplicative operators bind left to right.
<H4>4.4 Additive Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The binary operators
<TT>+</TT>
and
<TT>-</TT>
are add and subtract.   The additive
operators bind left to right.
<H4>4.5. Shift Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The binary operators
<TT>&#60;&#60;</TT>
and
<TT>&#62;&#62;</TT>
are
left and right shift respectively.  The left rvalue operand is taken as a bit pattern.   The
right operand is taken as an integer shift count.   The result is
the bit pattern shifted by the shift count.   Vacated bits are
filled with zeros.  Thus, 8&#60;&#60;2 gives 32, while 8&#62;&#62;2 gives 2.   The
result is undefined if the shift count is negative or larger than
36.  The shift operators bind left to right.
<H4>4.6 Relational Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The relational operators
<TT>&#60;</TT>
(less than),
<TT>&#60;=</TT>
(less than or equal
to),
<TT>&#62;</TT>
(greater than), and
<TT>&#62;=</TT>
(greater than or equal to) take integer rvalue operands.  The result is 1 if the operands are in
the given relation to one another, and O otherwise.
<H4>4.7 Equality Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The equality operators
<TT>==</TT>
( equal to) and
<TT>!=</TT>
(not equal to) perform similarly to the relational operators.
<H4>4.8 AND Operator
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The AND operator
<TT>&amp;</TT>
takes bit patterns as operands.   The result
is the bit pattern that is the bit-wise AND of the operands.   The
AND operator binds left to right.
<H4>4.9 Exclusive OR Operator
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The Exclusive OR operator <TT>^</TT>
performs exactly as AND, but the
result is the bit-wise exclusive OR of the operands.   The Exclusive OR operator binds left to right.
<H4>4.10 OR Operator
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The OR operator
<TT>|</TT>
performs exactly as AND, but the result is the
bit-wise inclusive OR of the operands.  The OR operator also
binds left to right.
<H4>4.11 Conditional Expression
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Three rvalue expressions separated by
<TT>?</TT>
and
<TT>:</TT>
form a conditional
expression.  The first expression (to the left of the ?) is
evaluated.  If the result is non-zero, the second expression is
evaluated and the third ignored.  If the value is zero, the
second expression is ignored and the third is evaluated.   The
result is either the evaluation of the second or third expression.  Thus,  a&#60;b?a:b returns the value of a if a is strictiy less
than b,  and b otherwise; i.e., it computes min(a,b).
<br>&#32;<br>
Binding is right to left. Thus a?b:c?d:e is a?b:(c?d:e).
<H4>4.12 Assignment Operators
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
There are 17 assignment operators in B.  All require an lvalue
on the left and an rvalue on the right.  The simple assignment
operator
evaluates<TT>=</TT>merely
the lvalue.  The assignment operators
<TT>=*</TT>,
<TT>=/</TT>,
<TT>=%</TT>,
<TT>=+</TT>,
<TT>=-</TT>,
<TT>=&#60;&#60;</TT>,
<TT>=&#62;&#62;</TT>,
<TT>=&#60;</TT>,
<TT>=&#60;=</TT>,
<TT>=&#62;</TT>,
<TT>=&#62;=</TT>,
<TT>===</TT>,
<TT>=!=</TT>,
<TT>=&amp;</TT>,
<TT>=^</TT>,
and
<TT>=|</TT>
perform a binary
operation (See sections 4.3 to 4.10)  between the rvalue stored
in the assignment's lvalue and the assignment's rvalue.   The
result is then stored in the lvalue.  Thus the expression
<TT>x=*10</TT>
is identical to
Note<TT>x=x*10</TT>.
<TT>x= *10.   The</TT>
result of an assignment is the rvalue for simple assignment, and
the result of the binary operation for the other assignment
operators.  Assignments bind right to left; thus x=y=0 assigns
zero to y, then x, and returns the rvalue zero; similarly, if y
contains the rvalue 2, then x = y =+ 3 sets both x and y to 5.
<H4>5.0 Statements
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Statements define program execution.  Each statement is executed
in sequence.  There are, of course,  statements to conditionally
or unconditionally alter normal sequencing.
<br>&#32;<br>
Most statements end with a semicolon
<TT>;</TT>.
<H4>5.1 Compound Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
A sequence of statements in
<TT>{}</TT>
braces is syntactically a single
statement.  This mechanism is provided so that where a single
statement is expected, any number of statements can be placed.
<H4>5.2 Conditional Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
A conditional statement has the general form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement1 </I><TT>else </TT><I>statement2 </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
This evaluates
<I>rvalue</I>
and executes
<I>statement1</I>
if the rvalue
is non-zero, and
<I>statement2</I>
if the rvalue is zero.   Notice the
analogy with conditional expressions, section 4.10.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
The "else" clause is optional; thus:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
executes statement if the rvalue is nonzero, and skips it if the
rvalue is zero.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
As an example, the program segment:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if( a&#60;b ) x=a;
else x=b;
</PRE></TT></DL>
sets x to the minimum of a and b.
<H4>5.3 While Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The while statement has the form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
while ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement1 </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The rvalue is evaluated; if zero,  statement is skipped and control passes to the following statement in the program.   If non-zero, statement is executed.  The rvalue is then evaluated again
and the process is repeated until the rvalue becomes zero.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
The while statement can be used to write tight loops quite
tersely.  Thus, to call the function f 10 times, we may write:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
i = 10;
while( i-- ) f();
</PRE></TT></DL>
We may also write searches:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
while (v[++i]) ;
</PRE></TT></DL>
sets i to the index of the first zero element in the vector v.
<br>&#32;<br>
When statement is a compound statement, it can be broken out of
by a break statement (see 5.6).
<H4>5.4 Switch Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The switch statement is the most complicated statement in B.   The
switch has the form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
switch ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement1
</PRE></TT></DL>
Virtually always,  statement1 above is a compound statement.   Each
statement in statement1 may be preceded by one or more cases as
follows:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
case </I><I>constant </I><TT>:
</PRE></TT></DL>
During execution,  the rvalue is evaluated and compared to each
case constant in undefined order.  If a case constant is equal
to the evaluated rvalue, control is passed to the statement following the case.  Thus,  the code fragment:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
switch(x) {
case 'a':
   y = 1 ;
case 'b':
   z = 2;
   }
</PRE></TT></DL>
sets z to two if x has the value 'b',  sets y to one and z to two
if x has the value 'a',  and does nothing otherwise.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
If the rvalue matches none of the case constants, statement is
normally skipped; this can be changed, however, by preceding a
statement in statement by
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
default:
</PRE></TT></DL>
Control then passes to the following statement when none of the
case constants are matched.
<br>&#32;<br>
A compound statement following a switch block can be broken out
of by a break statement (see 5.6).
<H4>5.5 Goto Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The goto statement is as follows:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
goto <I>rvalue </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The rvalue is expected to be of type label.   Control is then
passed to the corresponding label.   Transfers into and out of
compound statements are legal, but use of labels as dummy arguments to transfer between functions or function invocations is
almost certain to cause disaster.
</TT><H4>5.6 Break Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The break statement has the syntax:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
break ;
</PRE></TT></DL>
It is used to break out of a compound statement controlled by a
while or switch statement; other compound statements are ignored
by it.  If a break statement is within several compound statements controlled by while or switch statements? the innermost
compound statement is the one broken out of.  Thus,  in the
program fragment:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
while (i--) {
   j = f(i);
   switch (j) {
   case 1:
     x = 5;
     break;
   case 2:
   case 3:
     x = g(j);
     }
labl:
   if( j &#60; 0 ){
      xy = 3;
      break;
      }
   xy = j/2;
more:
    ...
</PRE></TT></DL>
the first break statement is equivalent to "goto labl;", and the
second is equivalent to "goto more;".
<H4>5.7 Return Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The return statement is used in a function to return control to
the caller of the function.  The first form simply returns control.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
return ;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The second form returns an rvalue for the execution of the function.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   return ( <I>rvalue </I><TT>) ;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The caller of the function need not use the returned rvalue.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
A return statement is automatically generated before the closing
<TT>}</TT>
of a function definition (See section 7.3).
<H4>5.8 Rvalue Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Any rvalue followed by a semicolon is a
statement.   The two most
common rvalue statements are assignment
and function call.
<H4>5.9 Null Statement
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
A semicolon is a null statement causing
no execution.   It is used
mainly to carry a label after the last-executable statement in
a compound statement.  It sometimes is used to supply a null body
to a while statement (See the second example in 5.3).
<H4>6.0 Declarations
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Declarations in B specify storage class of variables, and also,
in some circumstances, specify initialization.   There are three
storage classes in B.  Automatic storage is allocated at each
function invocation, and becomes undefined upon return from the
function.  External storage is allocated before execution of the
program, and is available to any and all functions.   Internal
storage is also allocated before execution, but is available to
only one function; labels are the only current use of internal
storage.  Automatic and internal declarations result in immediate
allocation of storage for the variable; an external declaration
allocates no storage.  Storage is allocated for external
variables by means of external definitions (See section 7).
<br>&#32;<br>
External and automatic declarations should appear before the
first use of the variables declared; the declaration remains in
force until the end of the function in which it appears.   Internal variables may be used anywhere in the function in which they
are declared.
<H4>6.1 External Declaration
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The external declaration has the form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
extrn <I>name1 </I><TT>, </TT><I>name2 ... </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The external declaration specifies that each of the named
variables is of the external storage class.   Each of the
variables must also be externally defined.
</TT><br>&#32;<br>
If the first use of a name is immediately followed by a left
parenthesis '(', the name is typed external by default; thus the
library functions need not normally be declared.
<H4>6.2 Automatic Declaration
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The automatic declaration also constitutes a definition:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
auto <I>def1 </I><TT>, </TT><I>def2 ... </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
where each def has either the form
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
</TT><I>name
</PRE></TT></DL>
or the form
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
</I><I>name </I><TT>[ </TT><I>constant </I><TT>]
</PRE></TT></DL>
The automatic declaration defines the variable to be of class
automatic, and allocates storage for the variable.   When a name
is followed by a constant in brackets, the automatic variable is
initialized to the base of an automatic vector with size equal
to constant+1.  The actual subscripts used to reference the vector range from zero to the value of the constant.
</TT><H4>6.3 Internal Declaration
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The first reference to a variable not declared as external or
automatic constitutes an internal declaration.  The major use of
internal declarations is with labels; at the end of each program,
internal names not defined as labels will cause an error message.
A label is defined by writing
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
<I>name </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
preceding any statement.
</TT><H4>7.0 External Definitions
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
A complete B program consists of a series of external definitions.  Execution is started by the hidden sequence
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   main(); exit();
</PRE></TT></DL>
Thus,  it is expected that one of the external definitions is a
function definition of main.  (Exit is a predefined library function.   See section 8.0.)
<H4>7.1 Simple Definition
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
The simple external definition allocates storage for an external
object and
optionally initializes it; the forms are:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
<I>name </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
or
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
</TT><I>name ival </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
In the first form,  the external name is defined and initialized
with zero.  In the second form,  an ival (initial value) is a constant or a name; the external name is defined and initialized
with the value of the constant, or the lvalue of the name,
respectively.
</TT><H4>7.2 Vector Definitions
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
An external vector definition has one of the following forms:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
<I>name </I><TT>[ ] ;
</TT><I>name </I><TT>[ </TT><I>constant </I><TT>] ;
</TT><I>name </I><TT>[ ] </TT><I>ival </I><TT>, </TT><I>ival . . . </I><TT>;
</TT><I>name </I><TT>[ </TT><I>constant </I><TT>] </TT><I>ival </I><TT>, </TT><I>ival . . . </I><TT>;
</PRE></TT></DL>
The name is initialized with the lvalue of the base of an external vector.  If the vector size is missing, zero is assumed. In
either case,  the vector is initialized with the list of ivals
(See 7.1).  The actual size of the vector is the maximum of constant+1 and the number of initial values.  Any vector elements
which are not explicitly initialized have undefined values.
</TT><H4>7.3 Function Definitions
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Function definitions have the following form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
<I>(name </I><TT>( </TT><I>arguments </I><TT>) </TT><I>statement
</PRE></TT></DL>
The name is initialized to the rvalue of the function.  The arguments consist of a list of names separated by commas.   Each name
is defined as an automatic variable; the statement (usually compound) defines the execution of the function.   When the function
is invoked,  each dummy argument is initialized to the value of
the corresponding actual argument in the call; there are no side
effects on the actual arguments in the function invocation.   This
form of argument passing is frequently called  "call by value".
</I><br>&#32;<br>
For example, a function which returns the minimum of its two arguments can be defined by:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
min(a,b) {
    if( a&#60;b ) return(a);
    else return(b);
    }
</PRE></TT></DL>
<H4>8.0 Runtime Support for B in MH-TSS
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
<H4>8.1 Input/Output Routines
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
By far the largest class of routines in the runtime library for
B are the I/O routines.  This is largely because of the
nonuniform way in which I/O is done in MH-TSS, and also because
of a desire to give maximum facility with a minimum cost in core
utilization.
<br>&#32;<br>
The underlying I/O for B is character oriented, with two
routines, putchar and getchar,  forming the basis for the system.
By default, getchar picks up characters from the teletype, and
putchar writes characters to the teletype.  The I/O facilities
also permit the use of I/O units,  in a way similar to Fortran.
The default attachment of putchar and getchar to the teletype can
be easily changed to allow the reading and writing of one or more
ascii disc files concurrently.  I/O buffer management is handled
by the system.  A unique feature of the runtime system is the existence of an I/O unit which has the effect of sending command
lines to system; i.e., lines written to this unit behave as it
they had been written at   SYSTEM?  level,  and cause immediate execution of the specified SYSTEM level commands.   A detailed
description of the I/O routines follows.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>getchar()</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- this routine returns the next character from the
current input unit, right justified with zero fill.
The current input unit is given by the external
variable rd.unit, whose default value is O.   Unit O is
always defined as the teletype input unit.   If a unit u
has never been defined,  or is in end-of-file status,
getchar will return the ascii EOT character, denoted
'*e'.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>putchar(c)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- this routine puts the four ascii characters in c
onto the current output unit.   The null character
(ascii code 000) and the EOT character (ascii code 004)
are deleted whenever encountered, and are not copied to
the output unit.  Thus character constants may be output with expected results,  since the characters which
are not explicitly present are filled with nulls; putchar('ab') would result in the output of only two
characters, 'a' and 'b', to the output unit.
<br>&#32;<br>
The user must be careful to indicate explicitly the
newline character at the end of each line of output; in
character constants and strings this has the escape sequence '*n'.  If this is not done, all of the output
comes in one long line or record, resulting in probable
chaos!
<br>&#32;<br>
The current output unit is given by the external
variable wr.unit, whose default value is 1.   Unit 1 is
always defined as writing the teletype.   Another
predefine unit is unit -1, which is always defined
definition as the  system unit; a line written onto
unit -1 acts as if it was typed at "SYSTEM?"  level in
MH-TSS .  This gives users a simple and flexible way of
using many MH-TSS features without requiring a lot of
resident code,  or fancy bookkeeping.
<br>&#32;<br>
In general,  a user can switch units by simply assigning
an integer from -1 through 10 to either rd.unit or
wr.unit.  The smart user will make a copy of the current
unit setting and restore it after his function is
completed;  this increases the generality of his
program.
<br>&#32;<br>
putchar(c) returns c as its value; thus the statement:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
    while( putchar(getchar()) != '*n') ;
</PRE></TT></DL>
copies a line from the input unit to the output unit.
<br>&#32;<br>
We have discussed the default settings for units 0, 1,
and -1.   In order to read and write on ascii disc
files, it is necessary to open (i.e., access) the file,
and associate the file With a unit number:  Thus, we
have the two functions "openr"  and "openw".
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>openr(u,s)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- the string s is taken as a cat/file description,
and the file is rewound and opened as a sequential
ascii disc file with read permission.  An empty string
s is taken to mean the teletype.  The file will now be
known as unit number u; the external variable rd.unit
is set to u, so that the next call to getchar, getstrt
etc. will cause input from this file.   If u is not
between 2 and 10, openr does nothing.  If unit u is
open when this function is called, it is closed before
the access (See  close, below).  For error handling,
see the end of this section.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>openw(u,s)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- the string s is taken as a cat/file description and
the file is rewound and opened as a sequential ascii
disc file with read and write permission.   The null
string s is taken to mean the teletype.  The file will
now be known as unit number u; the external variable
wr.unit is set to u, so that the next call to putchar,
putstr, printf, etc.  will cause output onto this file.
If u is not between 2 and 10, openw does nothing. If
unit u is open when this function is called, it is
closed before the access (See  close, below).   For error handling, see the end of this section.
<br>&#32;<br>
The next three I/O functions are string, rather than character,
oriented.  They are implemented by repeated calls to getchar and
putchar to do the I/O, followed by packing or unpacking the
strings.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>getstr(a)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function reads the next input line into the
vector a.  The newline character at the end of the
input line is replaced by the string delimiter '*e'.   The
user is responsible for seeing that the vector a is big
enough to hold the input string in all cases; this must
include leaving room for the string delimiter.   This
function returns a as its value.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>putstr(a)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function copies the string a to the current
output unit by repeated calls to putchar.   The
characters are output successively up to, but not including,
the string delimiter '*e'.  Thus,
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   putstr(getstr(a));
   putchar('*n' );
</PRE></TT></DL>
copies a complete line from the input to the output
unit.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>system(a)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function copies the string a to the system output unit, unit -1.
This has the same effect as if the
string a had been typed at  "SYSTEM?"  level.   A newline
is not needed at the end of the string a, since the
system  function adds one.
<br>&#32;<br>
The next three I/O functions do important nonstandard operations.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>close(u)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- the unit number u is endfiled, and, if u was an ascii
disc file, the space for its buffers is reclaimed.
Files assigned to the teletype have the current line
(if nonempty) written out onto the teletype with no
following newline;  thus this function can be used to
force a prompting question before reading a response on
the same line.
<br>&#32;<br>
Upon normal termination,  each output unit is closed.
In some cases of abnormal termination, control is lost
and no wrapup is possible;  in this case, the units may
not be closed.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>flush()</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- the current output file is closed.   This is the same
as close(wr.unit).
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>reread()</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- this function causes the current line to be reread.
It is currently undefined for ascii input files; on the
teletype, it means that the next character to be read
will be the first character of the current line.   There
is an important special meaning of reread: if reread is
called before the first call to getchar, the first line
read will be the "command"; i.e., the line which
was typed to initiate execution.
<br>&#32;<br>
The highest level output function is printf; it is also one of
the most useful.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>printf(fmt,a1,a2,a3,...,a10)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function writes the arguments a1, ..., a10 on the current output unit under the
control of the string fmt.  From 0 to 10 of the arguments a may be present.   The format conversion is controlled by two-letter sequences of the form '%x' inside
the string fmt,  where x stands for one of the following:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
c -- character data (in ascii)
d -- a decimal number
o -- an octal number
s -- a character string
</PRE></TT></DL>
The characters in the string fmt which do not appear in
one of these two-character sequences are copied without
change to the output unit.
<br>&#32;<br>
Thus,  the call:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   printf("%d + %o is %s or %c*n", 1,-1,"zero",'0');
</PRE></TT></DL>
causes the output line:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
1 + 777777777777 is zero or 0
</PRE></TT></DL>
As another example, a permanent file whose name is in
the string s can be created with size n blocks and
general read permission by using printf together with
the system output unit and the  filsys subsystem:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
wr.unit = -1;
printf("filsys cf %s,b/%d/,r*n", s, n);
</PRE></TT></DL>
There are several additional points to be noted about the I/O
system.
<br>&#32;<br>
The first is that if a file which is being written on is too
small, it is automatically grown.
<br>&#32;<br>
The second point involves the treatment of cat/file descriptions.
There are two types of cat/file descriptions: complete descriptions and quick access descriptions:  A complete description is
a string containing at least one "/" character; a quick access
description contains
no "/" character.
<br>&#32;<br>
A complete description is viewed as accessing a permanent file
in the file system.  Thus,  if there is a file of the same name
already accessed (in the AFT) the previous file is deaccessed and
the access repeated.  If the file being accessed does not exist,
the access fails.
<br>&#32;<br>
A quick access description is viewed as accessing a file which
may or may not be permanent and may or may not be already accessed.
Thus, if a file of the given name is already accessed,
it is used.  If not, the user's catalog is searched for a file
of that name.  If the file is not found, a temporary file of that
name is created, provided that the file is being opened for output.
<br>&#32;<br>
Currently, cat/file descriptions may not contain permissions,
passwords,  subcatalogs,  or alternate names.
<br>&#32;<br>
Finally, there are two modes of error handling in the I/O system.
Under the default mode, failure to access a file will cause an
error message and termination of the job.   Under the  anything
goes  mode, access failures are not directly reported to the
user, and execution continues.  In this case, the functions openr
and openw return 0 if the access was successful, and nonzero
otherwise.  In all cases, failure to grow an output file causes
termination of execution.
<br>&#32;<br>
An attempt to read a character from a nonexistent file causes
character '*e' to be returned.  Writing on a nonexistent file
causes output to disappear without a trace.
The error handling mode may be changed by calling the routine
ioerrors:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   ioerrors( n );
</PRE></TT></DL>
will set the mode to the default if n is O, and to "anything
goes  if n is 1.
<H4>8.2 Useful Routines
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
This section describes a number of useful functions for simple
character and string manipulation, and storage allocation.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>char(s,n)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- returns the value of the nth ascii character, in the
string s, right justified with zero fill.   Characters
are numbered from left to right, starting at zero.
Thus char("abc",1) returns 'b'.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>lchar(s,n,c)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function replaces the nth ascii character
of string s by the rightmost nine bits of word c.  c is
returned as a value.  Thus,  if s has the value "abc",
lchar(s,1,'x') returns the value 'x', and sets s to
have the value  "axc".
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>charb(s,n)</TT>
<br>
<TT>lcharb(x,n,c)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- These functions are the same as char and lchar,
except that they operate with six bit characters.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>ascbcd(v,n,s)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function converts the first n ascii
characters of the string s to bed, and stores them
packed into the vector v.  If the string s has fewer
than n characters, trailing blanks are supplied to fill
out v to n characters.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>bcdasc(s,v,n)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- converts the first n bcd characters of the vector v into lower case ascii, and puts them into the
string s, followed by a '*e' character.  Trailing
blanks are deleted.  The user is responsible for seeing
that the vector s has enough room to store the output
string, which may be as long as n+1 ascii characters,
including the string delimiter.   This function returns
s as a function value.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>concat( a, b1, b2, . . .. b10)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- This function concatenates the strings
bl through b10 together (from O to 10 such arguments
can be present) and copies the resulting string into a.
The user is responsible for seeing that the vector a is
large enough to hold the resulting string.   a is
returned as a function value.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>getarg(a,b,n)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- A rudimentary scanning function is provided by
this routine.  getarg puts into string a the first argument
at or after character n in string b.   It returns
a new value of n which contains the index of the first
character after the argument returned.  An argument is
defined as a string of characters separated by blanks
or tabs.
<br>&#32;<br>
For example, the code:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
 n = getarg(a1,b,O);
 n = getarg(a2,b,n);
 getarg(a3,b,n);
</PRE></TT></DL>
would set a1,  a2, and a3 to the first three arguments
of b.  Thus, if b were the string:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
 "well done"
</PRE></TT></DL>
a1 would become "well", a2 would become "done", and a3
would contain the null string.  b would be unchanged.
<H4>8.2 Other Functions
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>getvec(n)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- this function returns a vector of size n (i.e. n+1
words) from the core hole,  The memory size used by the
job will grow if necessary to get the space.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>rlsevec(v,n)</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- this function releases the n+1 words of the
static vector v back to the system.  Calling this
routine with an automatic vector v as argument results
in immediate or eventual disaster!
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>nargs()</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- returns the number of arguments with which the currently executing function was called.
<br>&#32;<br>
<TT>exit()</TT>
<br>&#32;<br>
-- terminates the run gracefully, closing all open output
files.  A return from the main procedure simulates a
call to exit.

<H4>10.0 Compiling and executing programs in MH-TSS
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
B programs, can be run in MH-TSS through the use of the command ./bj
(for "B job").  This command, written by B. W. Kernighan and
s. C. Johnson, provides an interface between the B compiler and
the operating system. The syntax of the command is:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	./bj [(options)] [source [hstar] ] [spec] [spec] [spec] . . .
</PRE></TT></DL>
In the above command, brackets [] indicate optional arguments.
Source is the cat/file description for the B source file, hstar
is the cat/file description for the H* output file, and options
stands for the jrun options.  All cat/file descriptions in this
command which do not contain a user master catalog name are taken
to be part of the current user master catalog.  The arguments
denoted by spec above give other specifications for the running
of the job; there are the following types of specification:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
h=cat/file
r=cat/file
l=cat/file
s=nnn
</PRE></TT></DL>
The construction "h=cat/file" is used to specify an H* file when
there is no source file being compiled; i.e., the H* file is
being entirely constructed from libraries.   The construction
"r=cat/file" specifies that the random library cat/file should
have the output of the B compilation placed on it by means of she
RANEDIT automatic edit facility.   The construction "l=cat/file"
specifies that the library cat/file should be searched by the
loading process as part of constructing the H* file.   The "r="
construction also specifies that the associated cat/file should
be searched; i.e., it causes an implied "l=" construction.
The libraries specified by "l=" and "r=" constructions are searched
in the order in which they appear on the command line.   The
specification  "s=nnn" is used to specify an optional size for the
stack in B; the default value is 500 words.  Two words of stack
are used for each function invocation, together with one word for
each argument, and space for automatic variables and a few temporaries.  In this construction, nnn is an integer.
<br>&#32;<br>
The user should ideally possess an IDENT file, exactly as required by the QED utility programs such as ./list, etc.   If no
IDENT file is found, a temporary IDENT file is created by asking
the user for his ident card image and his userid.
<br>&#32;<br>
The "./bj" command works as follows: the first two passes, ./b1
and ./b2, of the B compiler are run in MH-TSS.  The result of the
second pass of the compiler is a GMAP program, which must be sent
to the batch world, compiled, and loaded with the B I/O library
(on file ./blib) to create an executable H* file. The ./bj command calls ./b1 and ./b2, and if no errors are detected, the GMAP
deck is submitted to the batch world; currently, this is done
using "jrun".  The snumb of the job is printed out on the terminal. When the job is completed, it can be run by typing
"/hstar" at system level, where hstar is the name of the H* file
in the ./bj command line.
<br>&#32;<br>
Several examples follow:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   ./bj name hstar
</PRE></TT></DL>
This is the simplest command; the B program on file "name" is
compiled, and the resulting H* file put on file hstar.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   ./bj (w) name hstar
</PRE></TT></DL>
This is the same as the first example,  except that the GMAP compilation is submitted with "wait" disposition by jrun.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   ./bj name hstar r=abc/blib
</PRE></TT></DL>
This is the same as the first example, except that the object
deck is saved on the library abc/blib.  (Note that a RANEDIT job
will have to be run to clear this library before any decks are
put on it).
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
   ./bj name hstar l=lib1 r=lib2 l=lib3
</PRE></TT></DL>
This is the same as the first example except that the object deck
is placed on library lib2m and the libraries lib1, lib2, and lib3
are searched, in that order, to create the file hstar.
<H4>11.0 Advanced Topics
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
This section describes the execution environment of B programs,
and tells how to write B-callable GMAP subroutines.
<br>&#32;<br>
B programs are recursive;  the stack pointer is kept in index
register 7.  Thus, during the execution of any function, the
return address is kept in address 0,7 , and the values of the
first, second, etc.  arguments are kept in addresses 1,7 , 2,7 ,
3,7  , etc.  If there are n arguments, the nth has address n,7;
the locations from n+l ,7 onward are used for automatic variables
and temporaries.
<br>&#32;<br>
When one B program calls another, index register 7 must be moved
forward to an unused portion of the stack; by convention, this
is done by the called program.   A call to a routine  "sub"  causes
the following GMAP code to be generated:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	tsx1	sub,*
	zero	s,n
</PRE></TT></DL>
In this call, s is an integer telling how much index register 7
should be advanced to avoid conflicting with the calling
program's use of the stack.  n contains the number of arguments;
this is never used by the calling sequence, but is available to
the user by calling the library procedure nargs.  Notice that the
tsx1 is indirect through the word sub,  instead of directly to it.
Functions and labels in B, because they point to executable code,
contain their addresses in the left half of the 36 bit word; this
means they can be indirected through.  In contrast, pointers
which point to data (such as vectors) have their addresses in the
right half of the word.
<br>&#32;<br>
Upon entry to the routine sub, the stack frame is bumped and the
return address is stored on the stack; the first three instructions are typically:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
sub	zero	*+1	pointer to code
	adx7	0,1	advance stack pointer
	stx1	0,7	store return address on stack
</PRE></TT></DL>
The return from this function is the reverse process:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	ldx1	0,7	restore return address
	sbx7	0,1	restore stack pointer
	tra	1,1	return
</PRE></TT></DL>
Because the return sequence is identical for all functions, and
a function may have several returns, this sequence of code is
stored in the runtime library with the external name .10000 .
Thus, the above lines are replaced by:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	symref	.10000
	tra	.10000
</PRE></TT></DL>
Arguments are passed by value, and never copied back to the
calling routine.  If there is one argument, it is passed in the
A register; if two, they are passed in the A and Q registers. If
there are more than two,  the third and later arguments are computed and stored on the stack so that they become addresses 3,7 ,
4,7 , and so on after the stack frame is advanced.  B programs
treat their arguments exactly as other automatic variables; it
is necessary, thus, to move the first two arguments from the
registers onto the stack.  This is done by a
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	sta	1,7
</PRE></TT></DL>
or
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	staq	1,7
</PRE></TT></DL>
immediately following the entry sequence given above.   The instruction staq demands that its effective address be even.  Thus ,
we have two restrictions designed to assure that index 7 is always odd:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a.<DD>
Index 7 is initially odd.
<DT>b.<DD>
In calls, the stack is always bumped by an even amount.
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
Functions return a value in the Q register.   The indicators are
not assumed set on return,  since the .10000 sequence destroys
them.
<br>&#32;<br>
From the above discussion,  the reader can write general
B-callable GMAP subroutines of arbitrary complexity.   If the
subroutine has at most two arguments, however, the stack need not
be changed, since the A and Q registers contain the first two arguments.  The general rules for this situation are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>a.<DD>
The A and Q registers contain the first two arguments.
<DT>b.<DD>
Index registers 2 through 7 must be restored to their
previous values upon return.
<DT>c.<DD>
Return is to location 1,1
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
As an example,
the following rather useless subroutine returns
the sum of its
two arguments:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
$	gmap
	symdef	add2
add2    zero	*+1
	sta	temp	store first argument
	adq	temp	add to second
	tra	1,1	return with result in Q
temp	zero
	end
</PRE></TT></DL>
Simple GMAP functions of this type are particularly useful as
interfaces to MH-TSS system calls ("derails").
<H4>12.0 Nasties
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
This section describes the uglier features of B on MH-TSS.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
The compiler makes sense of certain expressions with
operators in ambiguous cases (e.g. a+++b) but not others
even in unambiguous cases (e.g. a+++++b) .
<DT>2.<DD>
The GMAP assembler flags instructions of the form:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
	staq1,7
</PRE></TT></DL>
with "A" flags; in fact,  these instructions always work
properly, and are no cause for alarm.
<DT>3.<DD>
External names in GECOS may only be six characters in
length, and are in bcd so that case distinctions are lost.
Thus, the B names aaaaaa, AAAAAA, and aaaaaaxx all refer to
the same external function.
<DT>4.<DD>
The use of the operator &amp; in conditional statements has
been optimized to allow for conditional transfers and much
more efficient object code; unfortunately, there is a conflict between this use and the use of this operator in its
more usual sense as a bitwise logical operator.  Thus, the
statement :
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if( a&amp;077 )goto label;
</PRE></TT></DL>
is ambiguous; on the one hand, it could mean "if the last
two octal digits of a are not 00, go to label" (&amp; used as a
bitwise operator), while on the other hand it could mean
if both a and 077 are nonzero, go to label" (&amp; as a
logical operator).  This ambiguity is broken by always assuming the logical operator in a case where a truth value
is expected (if, while, and conditional expression). To
force the bitwise interpretation in the above example, one
must write
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
if( (a&amp;077) != O )goto label;
</PRE></TT></DL>
which is in fact optimized well by the code generator.
<DT>5.<DD>
Missing subroutines, perhaps caused by misspelling, cause
the GECOS loader to insert a  MME GEBORT at the
references.  This, when executed in MH-TSS, gives the message "Illegal opcode".  Check the load map to make sure.

<H4>13.0  Diagnostics
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
Diagnostics consist of two letters, an optional name, and a
source line number.  Due to the free format of the source, the
source line number might be slightly too high.  The following is
a list of the diagnostics.
<br>&#32;<br>

</I><H4>14.0 Future Plans
</H4>
<br>&#32;<br>
There are a number of desirable features missing from B in
MH-TSS .  These include the ability to use full cat/file descriptions when accessing a file, the ability to read and write BCD,
random,  and binary files,  and the ability to run in batch. A
number of these features could be added at once if an I/O interface to GFRC were written; this seems like the most likely future
extension to the I/O library.  It is almost certain that getchar
and putchar will remain functionally unchanged in this case.
Users are urged to gather their file accessing and error handling
routines in a small number of clearly marked spots, both as a
matter of good programming practice and to facilitate any future
changes that might be needed.
<br>&#32;<br>
B works tolerably well on the H6070, which is a word addressable
machine; when using a byte addressable machine such as the IBM
360/370 models or the PDP-11, B seems less attractive.   A successor language, C, is being developed which allows most of the ad-
vantages of B on byte addressable machines, as well as a structure capability.  While the case for C on the H6070 is not as
strong as it is on byte addressable machines, the structure and
character manipulation capabilities make it likely that C will
eventually appear on the H6070.
<br>&#32;<br>
A final area where progress is both possible and desirable is in
the area of debugging aids.  It would be fairly easy to add a
symbol table to the compiler output, provided that programs were
written to access these tables.
